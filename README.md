# ng2-play.ts

A minimal [Angular2](https://angular.io/) playground using [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [SystemJS loader](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)

This is a fork of ng2-play to demonstrate the use of [ng2-translate](https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate).

## Install

Clone this repo and execute in your favourite shell:

* `npm i -g gulp` to install gulp globally (if you don't have it installed already)
* `npm i` to install local npm dependencies
* `typings install` to make sure typings is properly configured.

## Play

After completing installation type in your favourite shell:

* `gulp play` to start a "Hello World" app in a new browser window. App files are observed and will be re-transpiled on each change.
